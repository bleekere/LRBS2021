# LRBS2021
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to (learn to) work with the automated text collation tool [CollateX](https://collatex.net/).

The notebooks are created for the London Rare Book School (LRBS) course *The Book Historian's Digital Tool Kit* that takes place virtually from June 29 to July 2nd, 2021. See the [website](https://port.sas.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=190) of the course for more information.

If you'd like to do more with CollateX, do check out these great tutorials: [the DiXiT tutorial](https://github.com/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial) *Code and Collation* (2016) and the [workshop](https://automaticcollationlausanne2020.github.io/) *Introduction to Automated Collation* (2020).
