# LRBS2021
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to (learn to) work with the automated text collation tool [CollateX](https://collatex.net/).

The notebooks are created for the London Rare Book School (LRBS) course *The Book Historian's Digital Tool Kit* that takes place virtually from June 29 to July 2nd, 2021. See the [website](https://port.sas.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=190) of the course for more information.

### Let's get started!
In order to work with the notebook, click on this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bleekere/LRBS2021/HEAD)

This will automatically launch a Binder, which is an online environment in which the software CollateX and the required dependencies are already installed. That means that you do *not* have to install anything to work with CollateX. 

Note that the launch of the binder may take a while the first few times a repository is used. This is because the binder needs to create your environment.

Once your binder has launched, click on the file `Automated-Collation-w-CollateX.ipynb`. This will open the Jupyter notebook. You're good to go.

### Want more?

If you'd like to do more with CollateX, do check out these great and extensive tutorials: [the DiXiT tutorial](https://github.com/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial) *Code and Collation* (2016) and the [workshop](https://automaticcollationlausanne2020.github.io/) *Introduction to Automated Collation* (2020). Note that for the 2016 tutorial you will need to install several software packages. The 2020 tutorial also uses Binder.
