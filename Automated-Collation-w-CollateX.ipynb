    "In this Jupyter notebook, you'll learn how to work with the automated text collation tool CollateX. Before you start, make sure you've seen at least the third video lecture on the Gothenburg model. Also, make sure you understand the principles of the Jupyter notebook. This is explained in more detail in the lecture notes of [session 5.2.](https://port.sas.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=190&section=6) of the LRBS course, and – if you would like to learn even more – you can read about it [here](https://jupyter.org/) and [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Jupyter_notebook.ipynb).\n",

    "Please note: run the code cells in this notebook in the right order. For example, you first need to tell Python that you need the Python library that holds the code for CollateX, by running the code cell `from collatex import*`, before you can start running the other cells. You can recognize a code cell by the `In [x]` on the left side of the cell.\n",

For instance, try different outputs (standard alignment table, html alignment table, svg_simple) or switch layouts (by adding `layout='vertical'` as a parameter). Try the difference between `segmentation=False` and `segmentation=True`. And of course, you can also change the sigla, the text of the witnesses, and the names of the variables.
